Very sad thing to watch,\u201d Trump said after returning to his summer residence in New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>The hearing\u2014just weeks after Trump denied state level financial fraud charges in a separate case in Manhattan\u2014came with the former reality TV star\u2019s mounting legal woes threatening to derail his bid to return to the Oval Office.<\/p>\n<p>The US government\u2014which has never before prosecuted a former president\u2014accuses Trump of violating the Espionage Act and other laws when he removed classified documents upon leaving office in 2021 and failed to give them up to the National Archives.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities say he conspired to thwart investigators and knowingly shared national security secrets with people who did not have the requisite clearance.<\/p>\n<p>After the hearing Trump jetted from Miami back to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he blamed President Joe Biden for his prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA corrupt sitting president had his top political opponent arrested on fake and fabricated charges\u2014of which he and numerous other presidents would be guilty\u2014right in the middle of a presidential election, in which he\u2019s losing very badly,\u201d said Trump, speaking from the front of the clubhouse, at a podium flanked by American flags.<\/p>\n<p>He was cheered by several hundred supporters, including 100 members of a conservative organization of Vietnamese Americans who had donned matching red dresses and chanted: \u201cWe love Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Travesty\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Trump enjoys strong backing from Republican voters, 81 percent of whom believe the charges against him are politically-driven, according to a new Ipsos poll.<\/p>\n<p>Antonio Rufa, 30, who had come to Bedminister to support the tycoon, called Trump\u2019s indictment \u201ca travesty\u201d while 57-year-old Vincent Larusso said the prosecution was designed to prevent Trump from running for reelection.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not democracy and people can see this from a hundred miles away,\u201d Larusso told AFP.<\/p>\n<p>The government has recovered more than 300 documents with classified markings from Trump since officials discovered his correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was missing, US media reported.<\/p>\n<p>The records were the work of top national security and law enforcement agencies such as the CIA and NSA, according to prosecutors, and some concerned the military and nuclear capabilities of the United States and foreign countries, and \u201cplans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The 49-page indictment, dismissed by Trump as \u201cridiculous,\u201d includes photographs of boxes of records stacked at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach residence, in a ballroom and in a bathroom and shower.<\/p>\n<p>One image showed that by December 2021, some of the boxes that had been moved to a storage room fell, with their contents spilling across the floor.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t play ball\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Trump dismissed his attorneys\u2019 attempts to comply with a subpoena for the return of the records, according to the indictment, which quoted him asking a lawyer: \u201cWhat happens if we just don\u2019t respond at all or don\u2019t play ball with them?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The runaway frontrunner in the 2024 Republican primary\u2014Trump leads second-placed Ron DeSantis by more than 30 points\u2014has been impeached twice over allegations of misconduct in office and was recently found liable for sexual abuse.<\/p>\n<p>He faces indictment or ongoing scrutiny in four criminal probes\u2014in Washington, Florida, Georgia and New York\u2014and could find himself on trial in multiple cases as he campaigns to return to the White House.<\/p>\n<p>The pugnacious billionaire has repeatedly complained that the investigations against him amount to a baseless \u201cwitch hunt\u201d\u2014and has vowed to stay in the race regardless of the outcome of the documents case.<\/p>\n<p>He said Monday he would appoint a special prosecutor on his return to office to investigate Biden, who is not facing any credible accusations of criminality.<\/p>\n<p>Republican leaders in Congress and Trump\u2019s rivals for the party\u2019s presidential nomination have largely glossed over the gravity of the allegations against him, instead attacking the Justice Department.<\/p>\n<p>Fewer than one per cent of US federal defendants go to trial and win acquittal, according to the Pew Research Centre.
