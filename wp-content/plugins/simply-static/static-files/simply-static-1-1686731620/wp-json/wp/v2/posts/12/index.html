Here, AFP breaks down what you need to know about BTS:<\/p>\n<p>Who are BTS?<br \/>\nAfter debuting on 13 June, 2013, the septet went on to become the first all-South Korean act to dominate the US and UK charts, raking in billions of dollars and building a global fandom, known as ARMY, in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Their embrace of social media meant they barely missed a beat during the pandemic, using direct engagement with fans online to cement their position as world&#8217;s biggest and most influential boy band.<\/p>\n<p>Despite earlier breakthrough Korean hits like Psy&#8217;s \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019, BTS are widely credited with bringing K-pop into the mainstream in the US.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a South Korean idol group, BTS have smashed so many preconceived notions and industry odds to become chart-topping, Grammy-nominated musicians,&#8221; Jeff Benjamin, Billboard&#8217;s K-pop columnist, told AFP.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Crucially, they did it not by adjusting their viewpoints, perspectives or languages to cater to the larger market but by firmly establishing themselves as the K-pop musicians they are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What do they do?<br \/>\nAside from music, the band has long championed global progressive causes, from the Black Lives Matter protests to fighting anti-Asian racism in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve spoken at the United Nations and appeared at the White House, while still remaining one of the most popular bands in the world on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to BTS, K-pop &#8220;was treated as a niche interest, separate from global culture&#8221;, Sarah Keith, a senior lecturer in media and music at Australia&#8217;s Macquarie University, told AFP.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;BTS&#8217;s global popularity has led to a change in this perspective. BTS has arguably changed how the world perceives South Korea.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>How are they celebrating?<br \/>\nIronically, the band is currently on a hiatus, with two members performing their mandatory South Korean military service.<\/p>\n<p>All able-bodied South Korean men must serve at least 18 months in the military, and after a years-long debate about whether BTS deserved an exemption, Jin, the oldest member of the group, began his service in December. J-Hope started his service in April.<\/p>\n<p>But the septet released a new digital single last week to celebrate the anniversary: \u2018Take Two\u2019, purportedly a nod to the band&#8217;s second chapter after a decade as musicians.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All seven members participated in &#8216;Take Two'&#8221;, their agency Hybe said. &#8220;The song conveys their appreciation for ARMY, for all the love you shower them with.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A number of important tourist spots across Seoul, including the Namsan Seoul Tower and Dongdaemun Design Plaza, will be lit up in purple &#8212; ARMY&#8217;s colour &#8212; in celebration of the anniversary.<\/p>\n<p>Band leader RM will attend the main event of the celebration in Seoul at the Han River Park on 17 June.<\/p>\n<p>On a break?<br \/>\nThe band, which is known to be extremely hard-working and have maintained a relentless pace of new releases in their nine years at the top, said last year they were &#8220;exhausted&#8221; and would take a break.<\/p>\n<p>RM said at the time that the K-pop industry &#8212; known for its cut-throat competition &#8212; was not allowing him to mature as an artist, saying he felt like a &#8220;rapping machine&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Since the announcement, BTS members who are still obliged to join the military have focused on their solo careers.<\/p>\n<p>Jimin released his six-track solo album \u2018Face\u2019 in March, with the single \u2018Like Crazy\u2019 earning him a place in the record books as the first South Korean solo artist to land the number one spot on the top US songs chart.<\/p>\n<p>Band member Suga is currently on his first solo worldwide tour.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next?<br \/>\nLocal media says the ongoing break may last as long as seven years if the septet decides to wait until all members complete their military duties before resuming group activities.<\/p>\n<p>In March, Bang Si-hyuk, chairman of Hybe and the mastermind behind BTS, said industry figures &#8212; including global ratings and album sales &#8212; showed a declining demand for K-pop, blaming the BTS hiatus.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It remains to be seen how the group can re-integrate as a seven-member group once they have finished their military service, as this is usually a difficult time for male artist groups,&#8221; Keith said.<\/p>\n<p>But the ongoing break could be &#8220;a growth period for BTS overall as members pursue solo interests and add more diversity to BTS&#8217;s output&#8221;, she added.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seoul this week marks 10 years of megastars BTS, the supergroup credited with bringing K-pop into the global mainstream and generating billions of dollars for the South Korean economy.
