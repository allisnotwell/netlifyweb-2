										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lionel Messi on Tuesday confirmed he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t think&#8221; he will play at another World Cup in an interview with Chinese media, after the 35-year-old led Argentina to victory at last year&#8217;s tournament in Qatar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said several times before that I don&#8217;t think so, that that (2022) was my last World Cup,&#8221; he said when asked by China&#8217;s Titan Sports in a video interview if he might feature at the 2026 tournament in North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see how things go but in theory I don&#8217;t think I will be around for the next World Cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seven-time Ballon d&#8217;Or winner is currently in Beijing where Argentina will play a friendly against Australia on Thursday.</p>
<p>His comments come after he said earlier this year to Argentinian newspaper Ole that it would be &#8220;very difficult&#8221; to play at another World Cup.</p>
<p>He will turn 39 during the next tournament.</p>
<p>Messi last week announced he would join MLS side Inter Miami after his two-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain came to an end.</p>
<p>Argentina will play Thursday&#8217;s friendly against Australia at the 68,000-capacity Workers&#8217; Stadium in Beijing.</p>
<p>The match is a repeat of the last-16 tie between the teams at the World Cup in Doha, which Argentina won 2-1.</p>
<p>With Chinese fans desperate to see the former Barcelona star in action, tickets have been rapidly snapped up despite being sold at prices rising to 4,800 Yuan ($671).</p>
